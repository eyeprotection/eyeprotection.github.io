Do you constantly look at an LED screen at work, during breaks or at home? Beware! This can cause eye strain, vision problems, dry eyes, and even anxiety and headache ( 1 ), ( 2 ). Since you can’t say goodbye to your job or social media (the job of millions now), you must take out 10 minutes every day to do eye exercises. These exercises will help relieve strain, strengthen the eye muscles, enhance cognitive performance, and improve visual reaction time and the shape of your eyes ( 3 ), ( 4 ), ( 5 ).

Take a look at a few tips for good eye health.</p> <h2> Tips For Good Eye Health</h2> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> Shutterstock</p> <p> Here’s what you must eat and avoid to keep your eyes healthy.</p> Increase your intake of <strong> beta-carotene</strong> and <strong> lycopene-rich</strong> <strong> foods</strong> or take <strong> vitamin A</strong> –<strong> rich supplements</strong> . Maintain <strong> good hygiene </strong> of the eyes by washing them properly with cool water or rose water every day. Rose water is effective in reducing eye strain and itching, especially in summers. <strong> Avoid touching the eyes </strong> without washing your hands. Keep a <strong> check</strong> on the condition of your <strong> contact lenses</strong> . <strong> Avoid</strong> <strong> too much sun exposure</strong> and try to wear UV protection sunglasses or a hat when you venture out in the sun. <p> There are also a few other things that you must be careful about. Take a look at the next section to keep your eyes safe and healthy.</p> <h2> Things To Remember</h2> In case you suffer from short-sightedness or farsightedness, <strong> visit your eye doctor</strong> regularly and replace old contact lenses as directed by him/her. If you contract any allergy or eye illnesses like a stye, pink eye, , do not self-medicate. Visit a doctor promptly. Eye exercises cannot reverse any eyesight problem, so before subscribing to any company that promises to do so, talk to your doctor. <p> To conclude, these exercises for eyes are simple to do and easy to remember. They can be done at home or work during a few minutes of free time. Stop making excuses. Your eyes are Nature’s most special gift, and you need to preserve them to maintain your connection with the world. So, keep ’em rolling!
