Blinking</h5> <p> Blinking is a simple way to keep your eyes fresh and helps them to focus longer. Computer users and television watchers tend to blink less, especially when they are intently focused on something. Whenever you blink, your eyes are going into a brief period of darkness which helps to keep your eyes fresh and discharges previous information to make them ready for new information, which reduces eye strain .<br> <br> </p> <h5> 2. The Figure Eight / Infinity Loop</h5> <p> This a great exercise for your eye muscles. This exercise helps you increase your eyes' flexibility.</p> <h6> How to practice "The Figure Eight":</h6> <p> 1. Imagine a giant figure of eight (8) in front of you about 10 feet in front of you. <br> 2. Now turn the figure eight on it’s side. <br> 3. Trace the figure of eight with your eyes, slowly. <br> 4. Do it one way for a few minutes and then do it the other way for a few minutes.<br> <br> </p> <h5> 3. Near and Far Focusing</h5> <p> This exercise will strengthen the muscles in your eyes over time and improve your vision overall.</p> <h6> How to practice "Near and Far Focusing":</h6> <p> 1. Sitting or standing, place your thumb about 10 inches in front of you and focus on it.<br> 2. Now focus on something else about 10–20 feet in front of you.<br> 3. Take deep breaths between focusing on your thumb and the object 10-20 feet away from you.<br> <br> </p> <h5> 4. Zooming</h5> <p> This exercise is a very effective eye focusing exercise, in which you have to constantly adjust the length of your focus. This helps strengthen your eye muscles as well. </p> <h6> How to practice "Zooming":</h6> <p> 1. Sit in a comfortable position.<br> 2. Stretch out your arm with your thumb in the hitchhiking position.<br> 3. Focus on your thumb as your arm is outstretched.<br> 4. Now bring your thumb closer to you, focusing until your thumb is about 3 inches in front of your face.<br> 5. Now move your thumb away again until your arm is fully outstretched.<br> 6. Do this for a few minutes at a time throughout the day.<br> <br> </p> <h5> 5. Around the World</h5> <p> It's important to stretch your eye muscles to help prevent presbyopia , which may happen where the elasticity in your eye deteriorates due to the lack of eye movement, making it harder to focus on objects at varying distances.</p> <h6> How to practice “Around the World”:</h6> <p> 1. Sit in a comfortable position or stand in a traffic-free area.<br> 2. Closed both eyes or leave them open, making sure that your head does not move when conducting the following eye movements.<br> 3. Look up and hold for 3 seconds and then look down and hold for another 3 seconds. If your eyes are opened, wait till your eyes focus on an object before moving onto the next eye exercise.<br> 4. Look to the right as far as you can and hold for 3 seconds and then look to the left as far as you can and hold for 3 seconds.<br> 5. Look to the top left and hold for 3 seconds and then look to the top right and hold for 3 seconds.<br> 6. Rotate your eyeball clockwise 2 times and then counterclockwise 2 times.<br> <br> </p> <h5> 6. Palming</h5> <p> This exercise helps relieve stress around the eyes and gives your eyes a much needed break. </p> <h6> How to practice "Palming": </h6> <p> 1. Make yourself comfortable while leaning forward on a desk or with your elbows resting on your knees. <br> 2. Place your two hands over your eyes with the cup of your palm covering your eyes, your fingers on your forehead and the heel of your hand will rest on your cheekbone. <br> 3. Make sure you can blink freely and are not putting too much pressure on your eyes. </p> <p> Palming gives you the opportunity to rest your mind and your eyes for a few minutes at a time. It may not sound like much of an exercise but it can make a big difference in your working day if you stop for a few minutes and do this exercise.</p> <p> <br> For more eye exercises visit: http://www.wikihow.com/Exercise-Your-Eyes </p> <p> Check out more eye exercises like this 5 step massage to help alleviate your tired eyes!</p> <span> Tags:</span> eye health Eye Tips eyecare Eyes <span> Related Posts:</span> <h6> 5 Eye Yoga Techniques to Improve Your Eye Sight</h6> <h6> The 5 Step Eye Massage</h6> <h6> Inside the Human Eye</h6> <h6> Eye Healthy Foods</h6> <h6> Healthy Vision in the Workplace</h6> <h6> 5 Ways to Protect Your Vision </h6> <h3> Find an ICL Doctor</h3> Use Current Location Back to Top <h2> Secondary Navigation</h2> Testimonials Life With Visian Safety Information Visian ICL Blog Contact &copy; 2020 Staar Surgical .
