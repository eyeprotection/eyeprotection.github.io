Wondering if eye exercises really do improve eyesight? Yes, these are actually natural ways to  improve vision because they act like vision training exercises. Try these simple eye exercises to increase blood circulation, relax your eyes, and improve your overall vision.</p> <h2> Simple Exercises to Improve Your Eyesight by Healing the Eye</h2> <p> </p> <h3> 1. Strengthen Your Eyes’ Near and Far Focusing</h3> <p> </p> <p> Focus on an object 5-10 feet away for 10-15 seconds. Repeat this exercise 5 times. Make sure you&#8217;re sitting down while doing this exercise to better help you relax. To improve this exercise, keep shifting your vision between a far object to a close one throughout the exercises.</p> <h3> 2. Move Your Eyeballs Up and Down</h3> <p> Close your eyes then move your eyeballs up and down. You can repeat this exercise 5-10 times. Do this exercise slowly all throughout. Make sure your eyelids are relaxed while moving your eyeballs.</p> <h3> 3. Exercise Your Gaze</h3> <p> Draw a geometric figure with your gaze while keeping your eyes open. Start with simple shapes like a circle, square, triangle, and rectangle. Then you can move on to complicated shapes such as a trapezium.</p> <h3> 4. Press your Temples</h3> <p> </p> <p> Push against your temples with your fingers for about 2 seconds and repeat this exercise 5 times. This exercise helps boost the flow of intraocular fluid in your eyes.</p> <h3> 5. Close and Open Your Eyes</h3> <p> Close your eyes for 3-5 seconds then open them. Repeat this exercise 7 times daily. This particular exercise relaxes your eyes. At the same time, it also helps regulate the blood circulation around them.</p> <h3> 6. Move Your Gaze in Different Directions</h3> <p> For 5 seconds, look up, then down, right and left; or in a circular motion. In this exercise, all aspects of your visual perception, including your peripherals, are maintained. It&#8217;s also the best exercise for people who are nearsighted or farsighted.</p> <h3> 7. Close Your Eyes</h3> <p> </p> <p> Close and relax your eyes for 30 seconds. This is the simplest way to give your eyes a break and relax them. The important tip in this exercise is keeping your eyelids relaxed as well.</p> <h3> 8. Look to Your Right and Left</h3> <p> Look to your right while inhaling then your left while exhaling for 30-60 seconds. As much as possible, do this exercise in a relaxed state. The best way to do this is by turning towards each direction slowly. After the exercise, close your eyes for a second.</p> <h3> 9. Stare and Turn Your Head</h3> <p> Turn your head right to left while staring ahead for 30-60 seconds. You can also turn your head up and down. This particular exercise increases blood circulation around your eyes. Make sure to finish in a calm manner.</p> <h3> 10. Blink for A Minute</h3> <p> Open and close your eyelids quickly for 30-60 seconds. This eye exercise improves blood circulation inside your eyes. It also helps clean your eyes by greasing them and lets your eyes relax by taking them away from light exposure.</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> Watch this video for 5 more eye exercises you should try:</strong> </p> <p> </p> <p> Eye exercises are not daily activities most people do.
